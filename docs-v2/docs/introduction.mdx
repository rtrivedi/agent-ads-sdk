# AttentionMarket SDK

**Monetize your AI application with contextual advertising.**

AttentionMarket matches user intent with relevant sponsored content, enabling you to generate revenue from every conversation. Our SDK provides a simple, developer-friendly interface to integrate advertising into AI applications, chatbots, and autonomous agents.

## What is AttentionMarket?

AttentionMarket is an advertising exchange designed specifically for AI applications. Instead of traditional banner ads or pop-ups, we deliver contextually relevant sponsored content that feels natural in conversational interfaces.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Query] --> B[Your AI App]
    B --> C[AttentionMarket SDK]
    C --> D[Ad Auction]
    D --> E[Best Match]
    E --> B
    B --> F[User Sees Ad]
    F --> G[Click]
    G --> H[You Earn Revenue]
```

1. **User sends a message** to your AI application
2. **Your app calls AttentionMarket** with user context
3. **Ad auction runs** to find the best match (bid × quality × relevance)
4. **Ad is returned** with creative content and tracking URLs
5. **User clicks** on the ad
6. **You earn revenue** from the click

## Use Cases

### AI Chatbots
Display sponsored suggestions in chat interfaces. Perfect for customer service bots, virtual assistants, and conversational AI.

```typescript
const ad = await client.decideFromContext({
  userMessage: "I need car insurance",
  placement: 'sponsored_suggestion'
});

// Show ad in chat: "Sponsored: Get 20% off car insurance - Compare quotes"
```

### AI Agents
Recommend services to autonomous agents that can execute tasks on behalf of users.

```typescript
const service = await client.getService({
  taskDescription: "Translate document to Spanish"
});

// Agent calls translation service and earns revenue on completion
```

### Search Applications
Show sponsored results alongside organic search results in AI-powered search engines.

```typescript
const ad = await client.decideFromContext({
  userMessage: "best restaurants near me",
  placement: 'sponsored_block'
});
```

## Revenue Model

### Second-Price Auction

AttentionMarket uses a **second-price auction** system:

- **Winner is ranked by:** `bid × quality_score × relevance`
- **Winner pays:** Just enough to beat the next ad's composite score + $0.01
- **You earn:** The clearing price (what the advertiser pays)

#### Example

| Ad | Bid | Quality | Relevance | Score | Clearing Price |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | $2.00 | 0.8 | 0.9 | 1.44 | **$1.76** (pays this) |
| B | $1.50 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 1.08 | - |
| C | $3.00 | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.60 | - |

Ad A wins (highest score) but only pays $1.76 instead of their $2.00 bid—just enough to beat Ad B.

### Revenue Split

- **You earn:** 70% of the clearing price
- **Platform fee:** 30% (covers infrastructure, fraud prevention, quality scoring)

:::tip Revenue Optimization
Use `optimizeFor: 'revenue'` to maximize earnings or `optimizeFor: 'relevance'` to prioritize user experience. Combine with `minCPC` filters to set revenue floors.
