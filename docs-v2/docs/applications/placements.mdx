# Ad Placements

A **placement** defines where ads appear in your application. AttentionMarket supports three placement types optimized for different use cases.

## Placement Types

| Placement | Use Case | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `sponsored_suggestion` | Conversational ads in chat | "Sponsored: Get 20% off car insurance" |
| `sponsored_block` | Dedicated ad section | Sidebar ads, banner ads |
| `sponsored_tool` | AI agent service recommendations | "Use TranslateAPI for translation" |

## Sponsored Suggestion

Conversational ads that appear inline with chat messages.

```typescript
const ad = await client.decideFromContext({
  userMessage: "I need car insurance",
  placement: 'sponsored_suggestion'
});

// Display: "Sponsored: Get 20% off car insurance - Compare quotes"
```

**Best for:** Chatbots, virtual assistants, conversational interfaces

## Sponsored Block

Dedicated ad section separate from main content.

```typescript
const ad = await client.decideFromContext({
  userMessage: query,
  placement: 'sponsored_block'
});

// Display in sidebar or banner area
```

**Best for:** Search engines, productivity tools, dashboards

## Sponsored Tool

Service recommendations for autonomous agents.

```typescript
const service = await client.getService({
  taskDescription: "Translate document to Spanish"
});

// Agent calls service API
```

**Best for:** AI agents, automation tools, task executors
