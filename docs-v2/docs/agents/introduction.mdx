# AI Agents

AttentionMarket supports **autonomous AI agents** that can discover and execute services on behalf of users.

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous programs that:
- Make decisions without human intervention
- Execute tasks using external services
- Can discover and call APIs dynamically
- Report results back to users

## Service Ads (Type 3)

Service ads are API-based ads designed for AI agents:

```typescript
const service = await client.getService({
  taskDescription: "Translate document to Spanish"
});

// Returns: {
//   service_endpoint: "https://translate-api.example.com",
//   service_auth: "Bearer token...",
//   transaction_id: "txn_123",
//   service_schema: {...}
// }
```
