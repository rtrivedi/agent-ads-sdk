# Quality Controls

Filter ads based on historical performance metrics to maintain high-quality user experiences.

## Quality Score

Every ad has a quality score (0.0-1.0) based on:
- Click-through rate (CTR)
- Conversion rate
- User feedback
- Historical performance

### Minimum Quality Filter

```typescript
const ad = await client.decideFromContext({
  userMessage: "I need car insurance",
  minQualityScore: 0.7  // Only ads with quality >= 0.7
});
```

**Use cases:**

| Score | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| 0.8+ | Premium applications, brand-sensitive contexts |
| 0.7+ | High-quality experiences, trusted brands |
| 0.5+ | General applications, balanced fill rate |

## Advertiser Blocklist

Block specific advertisers:

```typescript
const ad = await client.decideFromContext({
  userMessage: "I need legal help",
  blockedAdvertisers: ['adv_abc123', 'adv_xyz789']
});
```

Advertiser IDs are included in ad responses as `advertiser_id`.

## Category Filtering

See [Category Controls →](/controls/categories) for detailed category filtering.

## Combined Controls

```typescript
const ad = await client.decideFromContext({
  userMessage: "I need estate planning help",
  minQualityScore: 0.8,           // Only top quality
  allowedCategories: [318],       // Legal services only
  blockedAdvertisers: ['adv_123'] // Block competitor
});
```
