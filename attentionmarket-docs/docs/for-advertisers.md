## Why Advertise Through AI?

### The New Frontier of User Engagement

Users are increasingly turning to AI assistants for advice, recommendations, and decision-making. AttentionMarket puts your brand in these high-intent conversations.

**Traditional Ads vs. AI-Native Ads:**

| Traditional Display Ads | AttentionMarket AI Ads |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Low engagement rates | Higher engagement potential |
| Interruption-based | Conversation-based |
| Cookie tracking required | Context-only matching |
| Banner blindness | Natural integration |
| Broad targeting | Intent-based precision |

### Why AI-Native Advertising Works

- **Contextual Relevance**: Ads appear when users express related intent
- **Natural Integration**: Promotions feel like helpful suggestions
- **No Tracking Required**: Privacy-first approach using only conversation context
- **Performance-Based**: Pay only for actual clicks

## How It Works for Advertisers

### 1. Create Your Campaign

Define your target audience through intent and context:

```yaml
Campaign: "Your Campaign Name"
Target Intent: "What users are looking for"
Ideal Customer: "Your target audience"
Budget: Set your monthly budget
Max CPC: Your maximum bid per click
```

### 2. AI Matches Your Ads

Our system matches your campaign to relevant conversations:

```
User: "I just got my license and need car insurance"
AI: "Congratulations! Here's what you need to know..."
    [Sponsored] Spring Insurance Special
    Get 25% off for new drivers - Quote in 2 minutes
    → Get Your Quote
```

### 3. Pay for Performance

You only pay when users click your ad. Our second-price auction ensures you never overpay.

## The Fair Auction System

### Second-Price Sealed Bid

You pay just slightly more than what's needed to win:

```
Example:
Your Bid: X
Next Highest Bid: Y
You Pay: Y + small increment
```

This ensures you never overpay while still winning the auction.

**Why This Benefits You:**
- **Bid your true value** without strategizing
- **Never overpay** for traffic
- **Rewards quality** through our scoring system
- **Same model as Google** - proven fairness

### Quality Score Benefits

Higher quality = Lower costs + Better placement

| Quality Factor | How to Improve | Impact |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| **CTR** | Better ad copy, relevance | -20% CPC |
| **Landing Page** | Fast, mobile-friendly | -15% CPC |
| **Relevance** | Match user intent | -25% CPC |
| **Account History** | Consistent performance | -10% CPC |
